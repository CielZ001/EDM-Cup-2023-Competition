XGBoost and CatBoost perform the best for predicting students' performance in the online learning platform.\n","\n","The data analysis process involved several iterations. Initially, we only included students' action and problem information, resulting in a score of 0.67. We then added explanation details, which improved the performance to 0.69. Finally, we included sequence and assignment details, which led to a score of 0.7. Our findings suggest that students' actions and problem information are the most important factors for predicting their performance, which indicates that we can trace students' online actions and content details to predict students' performance.\n","\n","However, we recognize that there may be deeper information that could further improve our predictions. We will continue to explore the data to identify additional key features."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
